## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Scenario
A new alert appears in Microsoft Sentinel ‚Äî analyst must determine whether it‚Äôs valid, benign, or false positive.

SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| project AlertName, Severity, ProviderName, CompromisedEntity, Tactics, TimeGenerated
```
- Review alert title, severity, and correlated entities.

- Record investigation notes and attached evidence.  
- Escalate to Tier 2 with full query context and alert JSON export.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Automation Potential
- Logic App: parse new Sentinel alerts ‚Üí enrich IPs + geo-location.  
- Function App: auto-assign incidents by entity type and severity.
